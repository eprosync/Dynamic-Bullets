WARNING: THIS IS OUTDATED COMPARED TO THE BUILT-IN VERSION IN MWB

# Dynamic-Bullets
 Yes, very dynamic!
 * This is a project funded by nobody but me, cause I'm a really bored individual.
 * Wiki is still WIP, however you may go there now for information.

 Disclaimer regarding efficiency of dynamic vs traceline bullets. Even if this system is state of the art, it is still not as fast as single traceline bullets. This is due to the fact that lag compensation needs to be turned on per player firing the bullet until the life ends or dies. Also due to the face traceline is required to be called every calculation.
 
# This is a work in progress addition to all weapon bases!
 Expect some major bugs and issues!
